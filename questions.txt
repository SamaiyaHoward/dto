Data Types and Operations | Questions

Please answer all of the following questions thoughtfully and completely.



1a - What is the resulting type of two integers used together for an operation, like 5 + 4?
 an integer


1b - Is there an exception to this rule, with a certain operator?
yes, with strings


2a - What is the resulting type of an integer and a float used together for an operation, like -11.4 - 5?
a float


2b - Is there an exception to this rule, with a certain operator?
No


3a - What is the resulting type of two floats used together for an operation, like 2.3 * .45?
a float


3b - Is there an exception to this rule, with a certain operator?
No


4 - What is string concatenation? How does it work?
String concatenation is when two strings combind into one word. String concatenation works as two seprate strings are combined with an "+" operator.


5 - What is string duplication? How does it work?
String duplication is when a string is duplicated by the amount you choose. String duplication works by taking one string statement and multiplying using the "*" operator with the string to duplicate the statement.


6 - Can you combine strings and integers? What about strings and floats? What happens if you do?
No, you can not combine strings and integers this would result in a type error. You can combine strings and floats it would just results as a float.


7 - What does this tell you about how strings can interact with integers or floats?
Strings can have many things to do with floats and integers but strings has their limitations.


8 - Can you use one of the operators to determine if a number is even or odd?
yes, by using true division and dividing the number by 2.
